"""The FOMC decision calendar as sourced records (EH-412).

The Federal Reserve does not publish its meeting calendar or decisions as a
JSON API — only as HTML
(https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm) and one
press-release page per meeting. This module therefore reads a curated,
versioned dataset (``market_data_mcp/connectors/fomc_meetings.json``) instead
of scraping HTML at call time. Every record carries the Federal Reserve's own
press-release URL as ``source_url`` — never asserted as one of this package's
own findings. See ``AGENTS.md``'s "FOMC dataset provenance" section for how
and when this dataset was verified, and how to extend it.

No network I/O happens here; loading is a pure, cached read of packaged data.
